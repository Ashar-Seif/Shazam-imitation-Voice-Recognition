# Shazam-imitation-Voice-Recognition
 A basic implementation of shazam like  audio Recognition algorithm, it utilizes the advantages of a spectrogram and perceptual hashing :</n>

1- A database is formed of 241 songs (mp3 audio File) separated to their Vocals and music.</n>
2- Extraction of Spectrogram and spectral Features (Spectral centroid,Spectral Rolloff,Mel frequency Coefficient and Chroma STFT) is executed.</n>
3- Hashing the extracted data with a Perceptual Hashing Algorithm.</n>
4- A test Song is given to the application with extraction of its Hash the matches are found.</n>
5- Matching percentages are calculated according to a distance Hamming function.</n>
6- A testing mechanism is implemented by mixing two Audio files then this mix is given to the application to find it's matches in the database.</n>
